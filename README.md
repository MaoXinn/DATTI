## Datasets

* ent_ids_1: ids for entities in source KG;
* ent_ids_2: ids for entities in target KG;
* rel_ids_1: ids for relations in source KG;
* rel_ids_2: ids for relations in target KG;
* sup_ent_ids: training entity pairs;
* ref_ent_ids: testing entity pairs;
* triples_1: relation triples encoded by ids in source KG;
* triples_2: relation triples encoded by ids in target KG;

## Entity and Relation embeddings
The pre-trained Embeddings are stored in /Embeddings

## Environment

* Jupyter notebook
* tensorly
* tensorflow == 2.4.1
* Python == 3.6.5
* Numba
* Scipy
* Numpy
* tqdm

## Just run Tensor_decoder.ipynb block by block.
